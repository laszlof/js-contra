Javascript easter egg featuring the Konami Code (Contra)

This script will allow you to add an easter egg to your website.
When a user on your site enters the Konami Code:

```
Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A
```

A Contra character will scroll across the screen and an audio sample 
will play.

A basic example can be found in the 'example' directory.

Feel free to fork this, or use it in any project you wish.
