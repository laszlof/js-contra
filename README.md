Javascript easter egg featuring the Konami Code (Contra)

This script will allow you to add an easter egg to your website.
When a user on your site enters the Konami Code:

```
Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A
```

A Contra character will scroll across the screen and an audio sample
will play.

A basic example can be found in the 'example' directory. There
is also a minimized version that is slightly smaller than the full expanded
source.

Both the animated GIF file, and the audio OGG file are encoded into the
javascript using base64 for simplicity.

Feel free to fork this, or use it in any project you wish.

## Usage

Simply add the following to your existing page.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="javascripts/contra.js"></script>
```
